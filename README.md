# FAC-Application-Project [Project Gallery]


## ðŸ’¡Idea
I wanted to create a simple and modern card gallery. <br>
I first drew the design in my notebook by hand. <br>
Additionally, I wanted to include a "read more" button on each card, so that users could view a description when clicked.


## ðŸš€Feature 
I used flexbox to create the cards. <br>
Users can resize them based on the breakpoints (900px and 764px). <br>
When the window size is 900px, the cards are displayed in two columns. <br>
When the window size reaches 764px, a single column of cards is displayed for mobile devices.<br>
Each card has a "Read more" button that opens and closes the description text. <br>
I added a transition effect using CSS, so the description box opens smoothly from the bottom to the top.
